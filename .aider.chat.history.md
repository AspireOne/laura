#### This is a NestJS project. Create a cron job boilerplate files with all required code, so that I will be ready to add my own cron jobs  

To create a cron job boilerplate in your NestJS project, we will need to:

1. Create a new service file for the cron job.
2. Register the new service in the `AppModule`.

The files that will need to be edited are:
- `src/app.module.ts`

Additionally, we will create a new file:
- `src/cron/cron.service.ts`

Please add `src/app.module.ts` to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

#### /add src/app.module.ts  
> Added C:\Users\matej\WebstormProjects\laura\src\app.module.ts to the chat  

To create the cron job boilerplate, we will:

1. Create a new file `src/cron/cron.service.ts` with the boilerplate code for the cron job.
2. Update `src/app.module.ts` to include the new `CronService`.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

src/cron/cron.service.ts
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Cron, CronExpression } from '@nestjs/schedule';

@Injectable()
export class CronService {
  @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_MINUTE)
  handleCron() {
    console.log('Cron job executed every minute');
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/app.module.ts
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { ScheduleModule } from "@nestjs/schedule";
=======
import { ScheduleModule } from '@nestjs/schedule';
import { CronService } from './cron/cron.service';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/app.module.ts
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  providers: [AppService],
=======
  providers: [AppService, CronService],
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will set up the basic structure for adding cron jobs to your NestJS project. You can now add your own cron jobs to the `CronService` class.

#### Alright. So now if I want to create multiple cron jobs, running different code at different times, how should I structure it? Where should I create my cron job files, and where should I put the logic?  

To structure multiple cron jobs, you can create separate service files for each cron job or group related cron jobs into a single service file. This will help keep your code organized and maintainable.

Here's a suggested structure:

1. Create a directory `src/cron` to hold all your cron job service files.
2. Create separate service files for each cron job or group of related cron jobs.
3. Register each cron job service in the `AppModule`.

Let's create an example with two cron job services: `FirstCronService` and `SecondCronService`.

### Step 1: Create the first cron job service

src/cron/first-cron.service.ts
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Cron, CronExpression } from '@nestjs/schedule';

@Injectable()
export class FirstCronService {
  @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_MINUTE)
  handleFirstCron() {
    console.log('First cron job executed every minute');
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Create the second cron job service

src/cron/second-cron.service.ts
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Cron, CronExpression } from '@nestjs/schedule';

@Injectable()
export class SecondCronService {
  @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_HOUR)
  handleSecondCron() {
    console.log('Second cron job executed every hour');
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 3: Update the AppModule to include the new cron job services

src/app.module.ts
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { CronService } from './cron/cron.service';
=======
import { FirstCronService } from './cron/first-cron.service';
import { SecondCronService } from './cron/second-cron.service';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/app.module.ts
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  providers: [AppService, CronService],
=======
  providers: [AppService, FirstCronService, SecondCronService],
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This structure allows you to easily add more cron job services by creating new service files in the `src/cron` directory and registering them in the `AppModule`.

#### Create an OpenAI provider like this:  

To create an OpenAI provider, we need to:

1. Create a new file `src/providers/openai.provider.ts`.
2. Implement the OpenAI provider in this new file.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to create the new file:

src/providers/openai.provider.ts
```typescript

export const OpenAIProvider: Provider = {
  provide: "OpenAI",
  useFactory: () => {
    const configuration = new Configuration({
      apiKey: env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
    });
    return new OpenAIApi(configuration);
  },
};

    return new OpenAI({

      baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      defaultHeaders: {
        "HTTP-Referer": "https://laura.matejpesl.cz/",

#### how would I then use it in e.g. cron.service.ts?  

To use the OpenAI provider in `cron.service.ts`, we need to:

1. Inject the OpenAI provider into the `CronService` class.
2. Use the injected OpenAI instance in the `handleCron` method.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to make these changes:

src/cron/cron.service.ts
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
=======
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/cron/cron.service.ts
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class CronService {
  @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_MINUTE)
  handleCron() {
    console.log('Cron job executed every minute');
  }
}
=======
@Injectable()
export class CronService {
  constructor(@Inject('OpenAI') private readonly openAI: OpenAI) {}

  @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_MINUTE)
  async handleCron() {
    console.log('Cron job executed every minute');
    // Example usage of OpenAI
    const response = await this.openAI.createCompletion({
      model: "text-davinci-003",
      prompt: "Say this is a test",
      max_tokens: 5,
    });
    console.log(response.data.choices[0].text);
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, we need to ensure that the `OpenAIProvider` is included in the module where `CronService` is declared. Assuming `CronService` is declared in `AppModule`, we need to add the provider there.

src/app.module.ts
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  providers: [AppService, CronService],
=======
  providers: [AppService, CronService, OpenAIProvider],
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

#### I will have cron jobs defined at src\cron\name.service.ts. However, I need someplace to store the logic. In a NestJS application like this, where should I put there larger chunks of code? If I was using the usual module/controller/service structure, I would put it in service, however this is different, since this is not some endpoint - this is very different.  

In a NestJS application, it's a good practice to keep your code modular and organized. For cron jobs, you can create a dedicated service to handle the business logic. This service can then be injected into your cron job service.

Here's a suggested structure:

1. Create a new service file in the `src/cron` directory to handle the business logic.
2. Inject this new service into your cron job service.

For example, if you have a cron job service named `example.service.ts`, you can create a new service file named `example.logic.service.ts` to handle the logic.

Please add the following files to the chat so I can help you with the changes:

1. `src/cron/example.service.ts` (or the actual name of your cron job service file)
2. `src/cron/example.logic.service.ts` (if it already exists, otherwise I will create it)


#### Alright. I have one more questions about conventions I guess - when I have a resource with multiple names (e.g. post likes), shoud it be post_likes (e.g. post_likes.controller.ts, post_lies.module.ts) or postLikes?  

In a NestJS application, the convention for naming files and directories typically follows the kebab-case (hyphen-separated) format. This means that for a resource with multiple names, such as "post likes," you should use `post-likes` for file and directory names.

For example:
- `post-likes.controller.ts`
- `post-likes.module.ts`
- `post-likes.service.ts`

This convention helps maintain consistency and readability across the codebase.
