+This is a NestJS project. Create a cron job boilerplate files with all required code, so that I will be ready to add my own cron jobs

+Alright. So now if I want to create multiple cron jobs, running different code at different times, how should I structure it? Where should I create my cron job files, and where should I put the logic?

+I will have cron jobs defined at src\cron\name.service.ts. However, I need someplace to store the logic. In a NestJS application like this, where should I put there larger chunks of code? If I was using the usual module/controller/service structure, I would put it in service, however this is different, since this is not some endpoint - this is very different.

# 2024-06-11 02:57:26.410985
+Alright. I have one more questions about conventions I guess - when I have a resource with multiple names (e.g. post likes), shoud it be post_likes (e.g. post_likes.controller.ts, post_lies.module.ts) or postLikes?
